# Moving to Mesos from Bare metal - t.co service


## Static Partitions
- Wasted capacity
- Not fault tolerant
- Mesos uses containers?

## Issues

- Job Throttling
  - Sudden spikes in latencies because of cgroups - GC overhead was not taken into account which causes process freeze
    - What we learned - cgroups & cpu quotas
- Capacity Planning
  - Max traffic of the cluster was lower than our expectation
  - What we learned
    - Different CPU variants have different throughput
- Rethink service Discovery
    - Services get hosts and ports assigned dynamically
    - Used Aurora, hence ZK had all these information
    - What we learned
        - Use static proxies to forward connections
- No perfect isolation
    - Sudden spike in latency
    - noisy neighbours still affect us - mostly on the disks
    - Answer - move to Async write operations
