> ON AIR

150 people in total at work
Actual news room will have mostly 50 people

Text bulliten on the screen, can be fixed real time

Video failures (blur effect missed)
- Change the footage
- If no footage, use the textual screen
- If no text, no footage, just go back to anchor

Take aways from Newsroom for us
- Realtime errors vs Not realtime errors
- Textual typos can be fixed because of Autocorrect
- What happens in newsroom stays in newsroom
    - Hold them accountable but don't punish them as long as they can learn from it
- Have a culture, where new folks (grads) should have ability to talk to senior
