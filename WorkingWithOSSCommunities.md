## Community
- Communities are **social units** of any size that share **common values** and **interests**. 
- Communities are **controlled by the people** not by the leaders
- Communities can **look different** from the **inside** and the **outside**

## Sense of Community
- Valuable Membership
- Real Influence
- Integration and fulfillment of needs
- Shared emotional connection

## Creation of Community
- "Say Hello"? - Olden days
- `$ git init` - Nowadays
- `$ git clone` 

## Steps to create a community
- When a **group** comes together like on a **first date**
- **Growing demands** upon the facilitator - *Chaos*
- **Acknowledgement** of the weakness - *Emptiness*
- **Respect** and **empathy** - True community

## Work in a community
- Realize that **everyone is a member**
- Bring **new members** in your community
- Take care of the **next generation**
- Be as **flexible as possible**
- Don't be a **redshirt** - The Walking Dead
